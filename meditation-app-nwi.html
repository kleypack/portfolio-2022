								<h5>Problem</h5>
								<p>As part of my training for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ironhack.com/en/ux-ui-design/paris">Ironhack</a>, I was tasked with building a minimum viable product (MVP) for a “client,” the National Wellness Institute. NWI offers certification and training for wellness professionals, as well as tools and frameworks they can use to help their clients achieve wellness goals. The institute has numerous years of experience but has been slow to catch up with quickly evolving technology.</p>
								<p>I’d be creating a prototype for a new app that would allow coaches to connect with their clients, focusing on one specific aspect of wellness. The prototype needed to consist of:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>the <b>user flow for the main feature</b> of the app,</li>
									<li>a way for users to set up a <strong>profile</strong> with information relevant to their goals,</li>
									<li>a way for users to set goals and <strong>track their progress</strong>,</li>
									<li>the ability for users to <strong>share stats</strong> with their coaches (or vice versa).</li>
								</ul>
								<p>The app should be native to one platform, iOS or Android. I was also expected to provide at least one screen for any responsive device to demonstrate the ability for the app to further adapt to user desires and needs. I did not need to follow any existing NWI visual guidelines, but should instead create a new style guide for the app.</p>
								<h5>Solution</h5>
								<p>I noticed that NWI is largely focused on wellness <em>professionals</em>. The brief, though, included both these coaches and their clients.</p>

								<p>With my timeline of only 5 days, it would be nigh impossible to build a solution that met the needs of both groups. So for my initial scope within this first sprint, the clients—users of the app—would be my primary target. Building out the companion solution tailored to the coaches would be top of my list of next steps.</p>

								<h2>Re&shy;search</h2>
							</div>
							<div class="col-two-thirds">
								<p>I chose meditation and stress relief as the wellness aspect I’d focus on. Research showed that since 2012, the number of people practicing meditation globally has tripled, with meditation now roughly as popular as yoga in the US. It’s a fast-growing industry and practice, and, especially after the events of 2020, stress relief is at the top of many people’s minds.</p>
								<p>Subject-matter research gave me some insights into the practice of meditation itself:</p>
								<ul class="key-points">
									<li>Meditation is most effective when practiced regularly, with daily practice the #1 way to turn it into a habit.</li>
									<li>Even one minute of meditation a day has been proven to be effective.</li>
									<li>When trying to form a new habit, we must fight autopilot—dismissed reminders must be refreshed regularly, or the habit instead becomes to ignore them.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>To get a better sense of the app’s potential user base, I asked questions both with an online survey and six in-depth interviews of people practicing or interested in meditation.</p>
								<ul class="key-quotes">
									<li>“I truly believe in the positive effects of meditation, because I’ve felt them.”</li>
									<li>“It’s so hard to turn into a habit, especially when I’m stressed—which sucks, because that’s when I need it the most.”</li>
									<li>“It can be difficult to know if I’m meditating the <em>right</em> way.”</li>
								</ul>
								<p>With these responses combined with my subject-matter research, I was able to craft a problem statement that would guide my design decisions.</p>

								<h4 class="mt-small">Live fitness classes with a personal trainer, but for meditation.</h4>
								<p>Classes with actual trainers are extremely popular and successful in the fitness space—accountability keeps trainees motivated, and guidance helps them feel more comfortable. Applying this model to meditation can address issues with motivation and uncertainty found in research.</p>
								<p>In addition to live training, users could start “quick sessions” any time—pre-recorded 1- or 5-minute guided meditation sessions. Removing as much friction as possible is key to helping form new habits.</p>
								<p>With my concept validated, I crafted a mid-fidelity user flow for the onboarding process and the main screens of the app.</p>

								<p>After running usability tests on the mid-fi prototype, I adopted some key iterations. My initial flow asked the user to pick a payment plan and create an account before being able to view coaches and select one. Testers were hesitant to continue onboarding at this point, feeling they were being asked too much before seeing the real value of the app.</p>
								<p>So I made plan selection and account creation the very last steps of the onboarding process, after they were able to select a coach that worked for them. I also added the option to defer selecting a plan and begin a trial without commitment, which increased testers’ confidence in the app’s utility.</p>

								<p>As mentioned at the top, my next steps would begin with building out a companion platform for coaches to upload and manage their lessons and schedules, and to live-record sessions.</p>
								<p>Additionally, I need to build out a Settings panel for the client-facing app, giving them the option to modify their plan, switch coaches, and manage their account.</p>
								<p>And finally, I’d hope to build out a system of rich notifications. I envision this as allowing the user to schedule reminders to log Quick Sessions—but these would be smart and adaptive to user progress and activity.</p>
								<p>This project was a challenging introduction to the sheer amount of work involved in delivering an MVP. It was also an excellent challenge as far as time-management with such a tight deadline. Mental health and stress management are subjects that are extremely important to me, though, and I really enjoyed the work and would love to push the project even further.</p>
