								<h5>Problem</h5>
								<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/goodhumans.me/" target="_blank">Good Humans</a> needs a way to quickly introduce users to the app and its value proposition, while simultaneously learning about the user in order to craft a personalized action plan to help them reduce their environmental impact.</p>
								<h5>Solution</h5>
								<p>An onboarding process that first informs the user of the app, followed by a questionnaire to assess their current level of eco-consciousness and areas of concern to provide an action plan that fits their wants and needs.</p>

								<h2>Re&shy;search & in&shy;sights</h2>
							</div>
							<div class="col-two-thirds">
								<p class="mb-med">We began with an <a target="_blank" href="https://forms.gle/uioU8AzyijpTfpH29">online survey</a> that generated 98 responses, and by conducting in-depth interviews with five people within our expanded network whom we knew were concerned with their environmental impact to some, if not a great, degree.</p>
								<h5>From this research, we gained some key insights:</h5>
								<ul>
									<li>73% of survey respondents feel lost or overwhelmed at least some of the time when trying to manage their eco-impact.</li>
									<li>Feelings of guilt and anxiety are common. Users want help, but don't want to feel judged.</li>
									<li>Users don’t simply want to be told what to do—they want to be given action to take, step-by-step, in a way that feels manageable.</li>
									<li>84% would be interested in an app that provides guidance and recommendations.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Using these insights we crafted a persona, Camille, to capture the pain points and frustrations of our target users.</p>

								<li>warm,</li>
								<li>soft,</li>

							<p>It was also important to the clients that the app interface utilized dark mode. Darker colors consume less energy—especially with modern OLED screens—so designing the app to prolong battery life was a great way for Good Humans to practice what they preach.</p>
							<p>With these principles in mind, we crafted a moodboard that they were very happy with.</p>
